### Sortie roll:

###### When you want to do something that entails interesting risks:
- Narrate what you're trying to accomplish. Use your parts for inspiration if you need ideas!
- Determine which Parts you're using to accomplish that goal.
	- As long as the fiction agrees, their initial text is guaranteed to occur. Maybe that's enough to achieve your goal! If not, proceed.
- Build your dice pool:
	- Decide how much energy you'd like to pull from your reactor (1-6 d6s)
	- Idk, narrative stuff? Always cool, but gut says the reactor provides the juice soâ€¦
- Roll and select outcomes from among your selected parts
	- 6 = 2 outcomes
	- 4-5 = 1 outcome

### Harm roll
###### When your mech is subjected to harm:
- Build your dice pool
	- Armor value
	- minus harm of the hit `(harm range is 1-3)`

### Heat roll
###### When your heat meets or exceeds your Heatsink value:
- Build your dice pool

	- Shutdown or Meltdown
	- Heat is not zeroed `(overflow still clears)`
